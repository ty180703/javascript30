# JavaScript 30-Day Challenge

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through the JavaScript 30-Day Challenge, where I dedicated each day to improving my JavaScript skills. The challenge involved watching tutorials, completing hands-on exercises, and engaging in independent learning.

## What is JavaScript 30?
JavaScript 30 is a free course created by Wes Bos that provides 30 days of coding exercises and projects, focusing on pure JavaScript. The challenge covers a variety of topics, from vanilla JS fundamentals to DOM manipulation, Ajax, and more.

## Learning Approach
During this challenge, I followed tutorials provided by Wes Bos and supplemented my learning with independent research. Each day, I tackled a new project or concept, gaining practical experience and reinforcing my understanding of JavaScript.

## Repository Structure
- Each day's folder contains the code and files related to the respective challenge.
- Code is organized and well-commented for easy understanding and reference.

## How to Use
